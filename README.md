# Deprecated

This workaround package is no longer needed. Use https://github.com/hexops/xcode-frameworks directly via the Zig package manager instead. See https://github.com/hexops/mach/issues/903

# xcode-frameworks-pkg

[hexops/xcode-frameworks](https://github.com/hexops/xcode-frameworks) is the Zig package to use when you need XCode frameworks, packaged for the Zig build system.

That package is well-designed, however there exists [a bug in the Zig package manager](https://github.com/hexops/mach/issues/903) (specifically `std.tar`) which prohibits using it: the package manager simply can't extract the tarball.

Once that issue is fixed, this package will go away. But for now, we have this temporary workaround: when you depend on this package, we use `git clone` to fetch the package - instead of the Zig package manager.
